A walk through A/B Tests for a new feature on a commercial website. Check out the .ipynb file for the Jupyter Notebook->

Udacity published a great free course for A/B Testing, also known as split tests, which are online experiments used to test potential improvements to a website or mobile app. This Python notebook is a walkthrough solution of the final project.

Udacity's AB Testing course is presented by Google and focuses on design and analysis of A/B tests. The course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power and how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions.
