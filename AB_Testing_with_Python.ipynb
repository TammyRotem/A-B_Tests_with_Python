The course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power and how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions."

After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n* If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n\n\n### 2.2 Description of Experimented Change <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"description\"></a>\n\n* In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course.\n* If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n* At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. [This screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByAfiG8HpNUMakVrS0s4cGN2TjQ/view) shows what the experiment looks like.\n\n### 2.3 Experiment Hypothesis <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"hypothesis\"></a>\nThe hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n\n### 2.4 Experiment Details <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"details\"></a>\nThe unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page."

Basically, this means we pick metrics which we consider not to change (not to be affected) because of our experiment and later make sure these metrics don't change drastically between our control and experiment groups.<br>\nEvaluation metrics on the other hand, are the metrics in which we expect to see a change, and are relevant to the business goals we aim to achieve. For each metric we state a $Dmin$ - which marks the minimum change which is practically significant to the business. For instance, stating that any increase in retention that is under 2%, even if statistically significant, is not practical to the business.\n### 3.1 Invariate Metrics - Sanity Checks <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"invariate\"></a>\n\n| Metric Name  | Metric Formula  | $Dmin$  | Notation |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| Number of Cookies in Course Overview Page  | # unique daily cookies on page | 3000 cookies  | $C_k$ |\n| Number of Clicks on Free Trial Button  | # unique daily cookies who clicked  | 240 clicks | $C_l$ |\n| Free Trial button Click-Through-Probability  | $\\frac{C_l}{C_k}$ | 0.01  | $CTP$ | \n\n### 3.2 Evaluation Metrics - Performance Indicators <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"evaluation\"></a>\n| Metric Name  | Metric Formula  | $Dmin$  | Notation |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| Gross Conversion   |  $\\frac{enrolled}{C_l}$  | 0.01  | $Conversion_{Gross}$ |\n| Retention   | $\\frac{paid}{enrolled}$  | 0.01  | $Retention$ |\n| Net Conversion  |  $\\frac{paid}{C_l}$  | 0.0075 | $Conversion_{Net}$ |"

Assuming a sample size of 5,000 cookies visiting the course overview page per day (as given in project's instructions) - we want to estimate a standard deviation, for the evaluation metrics only. The sample size we are considering should be smaller than the \"population\" we collected and small enough to have two groups with that size.\n\n#### 4.2.1 Scaling Collected Data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"scale\"></a>\nFor all the calculations to follow we need to scale our collected counts estimates of metrics with the sample size we specified for variance estimation.

This amount will be divided into tthe two groups: control and experiment. This calculation can be done using an [online calculator](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) or by calculating directly using the required formula.\n\nThe minimum sample size for control and experiment groups, which provides probability of Type I Error $\\alpha$, Power $1-\\beta$, detectable effect $d$ and baseline conversion rate $p$ (simple hypothesis $H_0 : P_{cont} - P_{exp} = 0$ against simple alternative $H_A : P_{cont} - P_{exp} = d$  is:\n\n<center> <font size=\"5\"> $n = \\frac{(Z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}sd_1 + Z_{1-\\beta}sd_2)^2}{d^2}$</font>, with: <br><br>\n$sd_1 = \\sqrt{p(1-p)+p(1-p)}$<br><br>\n$sd_2 = \\sqrt{p(1-p)+(p+d)(1-(1-(p+d))}$ </center><br>\n\nNow, let's break down what inputs we need and which calculations still need to be made. Regarding inputs, we have all the data we need:\nType 1 error ($\\alpha$), power ($1-\\beta$), detectable change ($d = D_{min}$) and baseline conversion rate (our $\\hat{p}$ ).\nWhat we need to calculate: \n* Get Z score for $1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ and for $1-\\beta$\n* Get standard deviations 1 & 2, that is for both the baseline and for expected changed rate\nAll these components will finally yield the number we need.\n\n### 5.1 Get z-score critical value and Standard Deviations <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"side_methods\"></a>\nWe are used to looking up this value in a table, but gladly we can use python's `scipy.stats.norm` package to get all the required methods for normal distribution. The `ppf` method gives us access to the [Percent Point Function (ppf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_function) or Quantile Function, and besides it being the inverse of the [Cummulative Distribution Function (cdf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function), this is the functions that will give back our required critical z-score."

This means the Gross Conversion rate of the experiment group (the one exposed to the change, i.e. asked how many hours they can devote to studying) has decreased as expected by 2% and this change was significant. This means  less people enrolled in the Free Trial after due to the pop-up. \n* **Net Conversion** \nThe hypothesis is the same as before just with net conversion instead of gross. At this point we expect the fraction of payers (out of the clicks) to decrease as well."

We assume the chance of a day like this is random (50% chance to happen) and then use the binomial distribution with $p=0.5$ and the number of experiments (days) to tell us the probability of this happening according to a random chance.<br>\nSo, according to the binomial distribution with $p=0.5$ and $n=$total number of days; we want to now the probability of $x$ days being a success (higher metric value in experiment). Because we are doing a two-tailed test we want to double this probability and once we have we can call it the $p-value$ and compare it to our $\\alpha$. If the $p-value$ is greater than the $\\alpha$ the result is not significant and vice-versa.<br>\n<center><font size=\"4\"> $p(successes )=\\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$ </font></center>\nRecall that a $p-value$ is the probability of observing a test statistic as or more extreme than that observed. If we observed 2 days like that, the $p-value$ for the test is: $p-value = P(x <= 2)$. We only need to remember the following:<br>\n<center>$P(x<=2)=P(0)+P(1)+P(2)$.</center><br>For more detailed information, visit [this excellent page](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_nonparametric/BS704_Nonparametric5.html).\n"
